# Maximal Rectangle Problem

## Problem Description

Given a `rows x cols` binary matrix filled with `0's` and `1's`, find the largest rectangle containing only `1's` and return its area.

### Problem Constraints

- `rows == matrix.length`
- `cols == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= row, cols <= 200`
- `matrix[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Example 1

**Input:**

```plaintext
matrix = [
  ["1", "0", "1", "0", "0"],
  ["1", "0", "1", "1", "1"],
  ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1"],
  ["1", "0", "0", "1", "0"]
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
6
```

**Explanation:**  
The maximal rectangle is highlighted as below:

```plaintext
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0
```

## Example 2

**Input:**

```plaintext
matrix = [["0"]]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
0
```

## Approach

This problem can be reduced to multiple histogram area problems. For each row in the matrix, think of it as a row in a histogram, where heights increase with each consecutive `'1'`. The key idea is:

1. Convert each row of the binary matrix into a histogram, where the height of each column is the count of consecutive `1's`.
2. Use the largest rectangle in a histogram approach to calculate the maximal rectangle area for each histogram formed.
3. Keep track of the maximum area.

}();
```

## Key Concepts

1. **Histogram Conversion**:  
   Each row of the binary matrix is treated as a histogram, where the heights of the columns are calculated based on the number of consecutive `1's`.

2. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**:  
   The `largestRectangleArea` function calculates the maximum area of a rectangle in a histogram using a stack-based approach, where we find the Next Smaller Element (NSE) and Previous Smaller Element (PSE) for each bar.

3. **Optimization**:  
   The `init` function disables synchronization with C-style I/O and unties `cin` from `cout` for faster input and output operations.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  The overall time complexity is `O(n * m)` because we process each element of the matrix once and calculate the largest rectangle for each row using a stack, which takes linear time for each row.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  The space complexity is `O(n * m)` due to the additional space used for the `prefixSum` matrix and the stack used in the `largestRectangleArea` function.

### Detailed Explanation of Each Section

- **Input and I/O Optimizations**:  
  The `ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);` commands are used to speed up input/output operations by unsynchronizing C++ streams with C-style I/O functions.

- **Edge Case**:  
  If the input matrix is empty, we immediately return `0` since no rectangle can exist.

- **Variables**:

  - `m`: The number of rows in the matrix.
  - `n`: The number of columns in the matrix.
  - `left[]`: An array that keeps track of the left boundary (the furthest left position where `1's` can form a rectangle for each column).
  - `right[]`: An array that keeps track of the right boundary (the furthest right position where `1's` can form a rectangle for each column).
  - `height[]`: An array that keeps track of the height of consecutive `1's` up to the current row for each column.
  - `maxarea`: The maximum rectangle area found during the entire computation.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Updating Heights**: For every cell in the current row, if the value is `'1'`, increment the height; otherwise, reset it to `0`.
  2. **Updating Left Boundaries**: For every column, calculate how far the left boundary of the rectangle can extend, ensuring that it's consistent with previous rows.
  3. **Updating Right Boundaries**: Similarly, calculate how far the right boundary of the rectangle can extend, ensuring it doesn't exceed earlier restrictions.
  4. **Calculating Area**: For each column, compute the area using the height, left, and right arrays and update the maximum area if the current one is larger.

This solution ensures that the time complexity remains linear, i.e., `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. The space complexity is `O(n)` for the three auxiliary arrays (`left`, `right`, `height`).
