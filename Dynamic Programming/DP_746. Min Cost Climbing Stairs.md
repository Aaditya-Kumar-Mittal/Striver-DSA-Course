## Introduction

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of the `i-th` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You can start from either step 0 or step 1. The goal is to determine the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

---

## Problem Description

Given an array `cost` of size `n`:

- `cost[i]` represents the cost of the `i-th` step.
- Starting from step `0` or `1`, you can only climb one or two steps at a time.

Your task is to find the minimum total cost required to reach the top of the staircase.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```bash
cost = [10, 15, 20]
```

**Output:**

```bash
15
```

**Explanation:**

- Start at step 1.
- Pay `15` and climb two steps to reach the top.
- Total cost: `15`.

### Example 2

**Input:**

```bash
cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
```

**Output:**

```bash
6
```

**Explanation:**

- Start at step 0.
- Pay `1` and climb two steps to step 2.
- Pay `1` and climb two steps to step 4.
- Pay `1` and climb two steps to step 6.
- Pay `1` and climb one step to step 7.
- Pay `1` and climb two steps to step 9.
- Pay `1` and climb one step to the top.
- Total cost: `6`.

## Constraints

- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

---

## Approach

### Recursive Solution

A simple recursive approach involves computing the minimum cost from each step recursively. Starting at either step 0 or 1, calculate the cost of climbing either one or two steps at a time.

#### Recursive Relation

Let `f(i)` represent the minimum cost to reach step `i`. The recursive relation is:

```math
f(i) = cost[i] + min(f(i-1), f(i-2))
```

The base cases are:

- `f(0) = cost[0]`
- `f(1) = cost[1]`

The result is:

```math
min(f(n-1), f(n-2))
```

### Memoization Solution

To optimize the recursive solution, we use memoization to store previously computed results.

1. Use a 1D `dp` array where `dp[i]` stores the minimum cost to reach step `i`.
2. On each recursive call, check if the value for `dp[i]` has already been computed. If yes, return it.

### Tabulation Solution

Using a bottom-up approach:

1. Create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach step `i`.
2. Initialize:
   - `dp[0] = cost[0]`
   - `dp[1] = cost[1]`
3. For each subsequent step `i`:

   ```math
   dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])
   ```

4. The result is `min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])`.

### Space Optimized Tabulation

Instead of maintaining a full `dp` array, only keep track of the last two computed results.

1. Use two variables, `prev1` and `prev2`, to store the costs of the two most recent steps.
2. Iteratively update these variables to calculate the current step's cost.

## C++ Code

### Space Optimized Tabulation Function

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = cost.size();

        // Base cases
        int prev1 = cost[0];
        int prev2 = cost[1];

        if (n <= 2)
            return min(prev1, prev2);

        // Iterate through steps
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            int curri = cost[i] + min(prev1, prev2);
            prev1 = prev2;
            prev2 = curri;
        }

        // Return the minimum cost to reach the top
        return min(prev1, prev2);
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **Recursive Solution:** Exponential, \(O(2^n)\), due to repeated calculations.
- **Memoization Solution:** Linear, \(O(n)\), with \(n\) recursive calls.
- **Tabulation Solution:** Linear, \(O(n)\), iterating through all steps.
- **Space Optimized Tabulation:** Linear, \(O(n)\), but uses constant space.

### Space Complexity

- **Recursive Solution:** \(O(n)\) for the recursion stack.
- **Memoization Solution:** \(O(n)\) for the `dp` array.
- **Tabulation Solution:** \(O(n)\) for the `dp` array.
- **Space Optimized Tabulation:** \(O(1)\) for the two variables.

## How to Run the Code

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ solution.cpp -o solution`.
2. Run the program: `./solution`.
3. Input the `cost` array.
4. The output will be the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase.

## Other Solutions for Min Cost Climbing Stairs

This document provides step-by-step explanations and implementations of various approaches to solve the **Min Cost Climbing Stairs** problem.

Given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of stepping on the \(i^{th}\) stair, determine the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase. You can start from either the first or the second step, and you can climb one or two steps at a time.

---

### Step 1: Identify a Recurrence Relation

The problem can be broken down into subproblems:

- \( \text{mincost}(i) = \text{cost}[i] + \min(\text{mincost}(i-1), \text{mincost}(i-2)) \)

#### Base Cases

- \( \text{mincost}(0) = \text{cost}[0] \)
- \( \text{mincost}(1) = \text{cost}[1] \)

---

### Step 2: Convert the Recurrence Relation to Recursion

#### Recursive Top-Down Solution (Exponential Time Complexity - \(O(2^n)\))

```java
public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
    int n = cost.length;
    return Math.min(minCost(cost, n - 1), minCost(cost, n - 2));
}

private int minCost(int[] cost, int n) {
    if (n < 0) return 0;
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return cost[n];
    return cost[n] + Math.min(minCost(cost, n - 1), minCost(cost, n - 2));
}
```

---

### Step 3: Optimization 1 - Add Memoization (Top-Down DP)

#### Top-Down Memoization Solution (Linear Time Complexity - \(O(n)\))

Memoization avoids redundant computations by storing results of subproblems.

```java
int[] dp;

public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
    int n = cost.length;
    dp = new int[n];
    return Math.min(minCost(cost, n - 1), minCost(cost, n - 2));
}

private int minCost(int[] cost, int n) {
    if (n < 0) return 0;
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return cost[n];
    if (dp[n] != 0) return dp[n];
    dp[n] = cost[n] + Math.min(minCost(cost, n - 1), minCost(cost, n - 2));
    return dp[n];
}
```

---

### Step 4: Optimization 2 - Convert Recursion to Iteration (Bottom-Up DP)

#### Bottom-Up Tabulation Solution (Linear Time Complexity - \(O(n)\))

This approach iteratively fills a `dp` table, eliminating recursion.

```java
public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
    int n = cost.length;
    int[] dp = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i < 2) dp[i] = cost[i];
        else dp[i] = cost[i] + Math.min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]);
    }
    return Math.min(dp[n - 1], dp[n - 2]);
}
```

---

### Step 5: Optimization 3 - Fine Tuning (Reduce Space Complexity)

#### Space-Optimized Bottom-Up Computation (Linear Time Complexity - \(O(n)\), Constant Space - \(O(1)\))

This approach reduces space usage by maintaining only two variables to track previous results.

```java
public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
    int n = cost.length;
    int first = cost[0];
    int second = cost[1];
    if (n <= 2) return Math.min(first, second);

    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        int curr = cost[i] + Math.min(first, second);
        first = second;
        second = curr;
    }
    return Math.min(first, second);
}
```
