## Introduction

The **House Robber II** problem is an extension of the classic **House Robber** problem, where the houses are arranged in a circle. The robber is constrained from robbing two adjacent houses, which are connected with security systems. The goal is to maximize the total money robbed without triggering the alarm system.

## Problem Description

You are a professional robber, and your goal is to rob houses along a street. Each house contains a certain amount of money, and the houses are arranged in a circle. The challenge is that adjacent houses are connected by a security system, and robbing two adjacent houses will trigger the alarm.

Given an integer array `nums` where each element represents the money in each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

### Example 1

**Input:** `nums = [2, 3, 2]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2) because they are adjacent houses.

### Example 2

**Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

### Example 3

**Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3]`  
**Output:** `3`

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Approach

The problem can be approached in a similar way to the **House Robber I** problem, with the added constraint that the first and last houses are adjacent.

We can break down the solution into two main cases:

1. **Exclude the first house** and consider robbing houses from index 1 to n-1.
2. **Exclude the last house** and consider robbing houses from index 0 to n-2.

This leads us to a simpler problem that can be solved using dynamic programming techniques such as **tabulation** or **memoization**.

### Recursive Solution

The recursive approach would involve solving the problem by recursively considering each house and deciding whether to rob it or skip it. The key relation would be:

- `rob(i) = max(nums[i] + rob(i - 2), rob(i - 1))`

### Memoization Solution

To optimize the recursive solution, we use memoization to store intermediate results, which avoids redundant calculations.

### Tabulation Solution

Alternatively, we can use a tabulation-based approach, iterating through the list and filling up a table where each entry at index `i` contains the maximum money that can be robbed from the first `i` houses.

## Code

### C++ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int compute(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return nums[0];
        
        int prev2 = 0, prev1 = nums[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int curr = max(nums[i] + prev2, prev1);
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }
        
        return prev1;
    }
    
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 1) return nums[0];
        
        vector<int> temp1, temp2;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i != 0) temp1.push_back(nums[i]);
            if (i != n - 1) temp2.push_back(nums[i]);
        }
        
        int ans1 = compute(temp1);
        int ans2 = compute(temp2);
        return max(ans1, ans2);
    }
};
```

### Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        
        int[] temp1 = new int[nums.length - 1];
        int[] temp2 = new int[nums.length - 1];
        
        System.arraycopy(nums, 1, temp1, 0, nums.length - 1);
        System.arraycopy(nums, 0, temp2, 0, nums.length - 1);
        
        return Math.max(robHelper(temp1), robHelper(temp2));
    }
    
    private int robHelper(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        if (nums.length == 1) return nums[0];
        
        int prev2 = 0, prev1 = nums[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int curr = Math.max(nums[i] + prev2, prev1);
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }
        
        return prev1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  - The `compute` function has a time complexity of `O(n)`.  
  - The solution calls the `compute` function twice, so the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the temporary arrays `temp1` and `temp2` used to store subproblems.

## How to Run the Code

1. **For C++:**  
   - Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler.
   - Run the compiled program, passing the `nums` array as input.

2. **For Java:**  
   - Compile the Java code using `javac Solution.java`.
   - Run the compiled program with `java Solution`, passing the `nums` array as input.
