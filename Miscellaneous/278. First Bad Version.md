## Introduction

This problem is a classic **binary search** application in software versioning. You are given a list of product versions from `1` to `n`, and it's known that starting from a certain version, all subsequent versions are "bad" due to a bug introduced at that point. The goal is to find the **first bad version** with the minimum number of calls to the `isBadVersion` API.

---

## Problem Description

You are a product manager and want to identify the earliest bad version in the development process. The `isBadVersion(version)` API is provided, which returns a boolean indicating whether the given version is bad.

Your job is to implement a function that finds the **first bad version**, while minimizing the number of API calls.

### Examples

#### Example 1

**Input:** `n = 5`, `bad = 4`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:**

```plaintext

isBadVersion(3) → false
isBadVersion(5) → true
isBadVersion(4) → true
Hence, 4 is the first bad version.

```

#### Example 2

**Input:** `n = 1`, `bad = 1`
**Output:** `1`

### Constraints

- `1 ≤ bad ≤ n ≤ 2^31 - 1`
- You are given the API `bool isBadVersion(int version);`

---

## Approach

We apply **binary search** to efficiently find the first bad version:

1. Initialize `low = 1` and `high = n`.
2. While `low <= high`, calculate `mid = low + (high - low) / 2` to avoid integer overflow.
3. If `isBadVersion(mid)` is `true`, this could be the first bad version. So, update `ans = mid` and continue the search in the **left half**.
4. If `isBadVersion(mid)` is `false`, search in the **right half**.
5. Loop ends when search space is exhausted, and the variable `ans` holds the first bad version.

## Detailed Explanation of Code

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
// Forward declaration of isBadVersion API
bool isBadVersion(int version);

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int low = 1, high = n;
        int ans = 0;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                ans = mid;         // mid might be the first bad version
                high = mid - 1;    // search in the left half
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;     // search in the right half
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

```cpp
// The API isBadVersion is defined for you.
// bool isBadVersion(int version);

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        while(isBadVersion(n)){
            ans = n;
            if(n == 0){
                break;
            }
            n--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- ⏱️ **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`  
  Binary search cuts the search space in half each time, so it takes logarithmic time.

- 🚀 **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
  Only a constant amount of space is used.

---

## How to Run the Code

### For C++

1. Create a file, e.g., `first_bad_version.cpp`.
2. Mock the `isBadVersion()` function for local testing.
3. Compile and run:

```bash
g++ -o first_bad_version first_bad_version.cpp
./first_bad_version
```

### Example Test Setup

```cpp
// For testing purpose
int badVersion = 4;
bool isBadVersion(int version) {
    return version >= badVersion;
}
```

## Other Insights

- This is a **monotonic predicate problem**—once a version is bad, all following are bad.
- Always consider **integer overflow** when calculating mid-point with large numbers (`2^31 - 1`).
- A variant of this problem is used in real-world A/B testing to detect the first failing release in CI/CD pipelines.
