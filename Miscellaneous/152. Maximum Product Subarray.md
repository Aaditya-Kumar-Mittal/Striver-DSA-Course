## Introduction

The Maximum Product Subarray problem asks you to find the subarray (contiguous elements) of an integer array that yields the largest possible product. This problem is tricky because of negative numbers and zeros, which can flip or reset the product.

---

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray within the array that has the largest product and return the product.

### Special Notes

- The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit signed integer.
- Subarrays must be contiguous.

---

### Examples

#### Example 1

```txt
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [2,3] has the largest product.
```

#### Example 2

```txt
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2 because [-2, -1] is not a contiguous subarray.
```

---

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10⁴`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- The product of any subarray is guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit integer**.

---

## Approach

We use a **prefix and suffix traversal** approach, which works by:

- Traversing the array from both left to right and right to left.
- Maintaining two products: `prefixProduct` and `suffixProduct`.
- Whenever we encounter a `0`, we reset the product to `1` because the product becomes `0`.
- At each index, update the maximum product found so far with the maximum of `prefixProduct` and `suffixProduct`.

Why both directions? Because negative numbers can flip the product sign, and we might have missed the maximum product subarray starting from the end.

## Detailed Explanation of Code

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxProductAns = INT_MIN;
        int prefixProduct = 1, suffixProduct = 1;
        int n = nums.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Reset product when encountering 0
            if (prefixProduct == 0) prefixProduct = 1;
            if (suffixProduct == 0) suffixProduct = 1;

            // Multiply with current elements
            prefixProduct *= nums[i];
            suffixProduct *= nums[n - i - 1];

            // Update max product
            maxProductAns = max(maxProductAns, max(prefixProduct, suffixProduct));
        }

        return maxProductAns;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  We traverse the array once from both directions simultaneously.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
  No additional space is used beyond a few integer variables.

---

## How to Run the Code

### For C++

1. Save the code in a file called `max_product_subarray.cpp`.
2. Compile:

   ```bash
   g++ -o max_product_subarray max_product_subarray.cpp
   ```

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./max_product_subarray
   ```

4. Include a `main()` function with sample input to test.

Let me know if you want the **Kadane’s variation approach** or Java implementation too.
