## Introduction

Given two integers `n` and `k`, the task is to find the k-th smallest number in the lexicographical order of all numbers from `1` to `n`.

---

## Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, the numbers in the range `[1, n]` are ordered **lexicographically** (as strings, not by value). Your task is to find the k-th number in this sorted order.

### Examples

#### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 13, k = 2
Lexicographical Order: [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Output: 10
Explanation: The second number in the lexicographical order is 10.
```

#### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= k <= n <= 10⁹

---

## Approach

### Intuition

Instead of generating all numbers and sorting them (which is inefficient for large `n`), we model the problem using a **prefix tree (Trie)** structure.

Each number is treated as a **node** in a tree where children are formed by appending digits `0–9`. For example:

```text
1
├── 10
│   ├── 100
│   └── ...
├── 11
├── ...
```

We perform a **lexicographical traversal** of this virtual tree and count how many steps (numbers) exist in the subtree rooted at the current prefix.

### Traversal Strategy

- Start at `curr = 1`.
- Decrement `k` by 1 since we've visited 1.
- While `k > 0`:
  - Calculate how many numbers are in the subtree rooted at `curr` using a helper function `countSteps(n, curr, curr + 1)`.
  - If steps <= k:  
    Move to next sibling `curr++`, and subtract steps from `k`.
  - Else:  
    Go deeper in the tree `curr *= 10`, and decrement `k`.

## Detailed Explanation of Code

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthNumber(int n, int k) {
        int curr = 1; // Start at prefix 1
        k--; // First number already considered

        while (k > 0) {
            int step = countSteps(n, curr, curr + 1);
            if (step <= k) {
                curr++;     // Move to next sibling
                k -= step;  // Skip 'step' numbers
            } else {
                curr *= 10; // Move to the next level
                k--;        // We've visited this prefix
            }
        }

        return curr;
    }

private:
    int countSteps(int n, long prefix1, long prefix2) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (prefix1 <= n) {
            // Count numbers between prefix1 and prefix2, capped by n + 1
            steps += min((long)(n + 1), prefix2) - prefix1;
            prefix1 *= 10;
            prefix2 *= 10;
        }
        return steps;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log(n) * log(n))`

  - Outer loop can run up to `O(log n)` times.
  - Each call to `countSteps()` takes `O(log n)` time due to tree depth.
  - Overall complexity: **O(log²(n))**

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - Only uses a constant number of variables.
  - No additional space or data structures.

## How to Run the Code

### For C++

1. **Copy the code** into a `.cpp` file, e.g., `kth_lexicographical.cpp`
2. Compile using:

   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++17 kth_lexicographical.cpp -o kth
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:

   ```sh
   ./kth
   ```

4. You may define a `main()` function for testing:

   ```cpp
   int main() {
       Solution sol;
       cout << sol.findKthNumber(13, 2) << endl; // Output: 10
       cout << sol.findKthNumber(1, 1) << endl;  // Output: 1
       return 0;
   }
   ```
