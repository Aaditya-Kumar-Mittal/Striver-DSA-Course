## Introduction

This problem is a variant of the classic Two Sum problem. The input array is sorted in non-decreasing order and we need to find the indices (1-indexed) of two numbers such that their sum equals the given target.

---

## Problem Description

You're given a **1-indexed**, **sorted** integer array `numbers`. Find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target`. Return their indices as `[index1, index2]` (where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`). Each input has exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice. Your algorithm should use only **constant extra space**.

### Examples

#### Example 1

```txt
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: 2 + 7 = 9. Indices are 1 and 2 (1-based).
```

#### Example 2

```txt
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: 2 + 4 = 6. Indices are 1 and 3.
```

#### Example 3

```txt
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: -1 + 0 = -1. Indices are 1 and 2.
```

---

### Constraints

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10⁴`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- Exactly one solution exists.

---

## Approach

This problem is ideal for the **two-pointer technique**, given the array is sorted. Here's how we proceed:

1. Initialize two pointers: `i` at the beginning (0) and `j` at the end (`n - 1`).
2. While `i < j`:
   - Compute `sum = numbers[i] + numbers[j]`
   - If `sum` is less than `target`, move `i` forward.
   - If `sum` is greater than `target`, move `j` backward.
   - If `sum == target`, return the indices `[i + 1, j + 1]` (since the array is 1-indexed).

This approach leverages the sorted property of the array and eliminates the need for extra space (like a hash map).

## Detailed Explanation of Code

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int n = numbers.size();
        int i = 0, j = n - 1;
        vector<int> ans;

        while (i < j) {
            int sum = numbers[i] + numbers[j];

            if (sum < target)
                i++;
            else if (sum > target)
                j--;
            else {
                ans.push_back(i + 1);  // 1-based indexing
                ans.push_back(j + 1);
                break; // Only one solution guaranteed
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  We only traverse the array once using two pointers.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
  Only constant extra space is used (no auxiliary data structures).

## How to Run the Code

### For C++

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed.
2. Save the code to a file, e.g., `two_sum_sorted.cpp`.
3. Compile: `g++ -o two_sum_sorted two_sum_sorted.cpp`
4. Run: `./two_sum_sorted`

You can wrap the solution class in a main function with sample inputs to test locally.
