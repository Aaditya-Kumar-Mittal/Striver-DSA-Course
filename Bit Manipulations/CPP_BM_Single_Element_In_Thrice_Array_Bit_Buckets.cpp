      Function to find the element that appears once when all others appear thrice.

      Parameters:
      - arr[]: Array of integers where every element appears thrice except one.
      - N: The number of elements in the array.

      Returns:
      - The single element that appears only once.

      Approach:
      - This function uses bitwise operators to keep track of counts of bits across the elements.
      - We maintain two variables `ones` and `twos` to track the bits that appear one and two times respectively.

Analysis:

Problem: Find the Element Occurring Once When All Others Are Present Thrice
Approach: Bit Manipulation (Bucket Concept)

1. **Concept**:
   - The problem requires finding an element that appears exactly once while all other elements appear exactly three times.
   - A direct approach using hash maps would take O(N) space, but we aim to solve it with O(1) space using bitwise operations.

2. **Explanation**:
   - We use two variables, `ones` and `twos`, to track the occurrence of each bit in the array.
   - `ones` stores the bits that have appeared exactly once so far.
   - `twos` stores the bits that have appeared exactly twice so far.
   - By using bitwise operations, we ensure that bits which appear three times are reset, leaving only the bits that appear once.

3. **Key Steps**:
   - `(ones ^ arr[i])`: Updates `ones` with the current element's bits.
   - `(~twos)`: Ensures that bits that have already appeared twice don't interfere with `ones`.
   - Similarly, we update `twos` while ensuring that bits in `ones` donâ€™t affect it.
   - After processing all elements, `ones` will hold the result.

**Time Complexity**:
- `O(N)` where `N` is the size of the array. We traverse the array once.

**Space Complexity**:
- `O(1)` as no extra space is used except for a few variables to track the bits.

**Example**:
For input:
N = 4
arr = {3, 3, 2, 3}
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 appears once while 3 appears three times.
